            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><b>Hi there! I’m Waruni Mishra, a recent graduate with a BTech in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) from Sarala Birla University, completed in 2023. I am excited to start my professional journey in the world of software development, problem-solving, and technology innovation.

                Throughout my academic career, I developed a solid foundation in computer science principles, including data structures, algorithms, database management, and software engineering. I’ve always had a deep interest in how technology can solve real-world problems, and during my studies, I immersed myself in various projects and technologies to apply the concepts I learned in the classroom to hands-on development.
                
                As a fresher, I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the tech industry, with a strong focus on web development, programming, and app development. I’m passionate about building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications, and I am keen to work on real-world projects that allow me to deepen my knowledge and expertise.</b></p>
